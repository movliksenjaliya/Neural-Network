Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile!

You will find here various projects that I have created, which demonstrate my skills and experience in programming, particularly in the field of neural networks and deep learning.

These projects were completed as part of a course provided by Coursera, which I highly recommend to anyone interested in learning more about this exciting area of technology. If you're interested in finding out more about the course, please visit the Coursera website for more information.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or comments.
